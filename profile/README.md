## Welcome to the UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst on Github ðŸ‘‹

The UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst connects researchers and innovators from a range of disciplines to varied training materials through the provision of a dynamic learning portal. The portal will provide a sophisticated and dynamic search function to enable researchers to easily locate training resources appropriate to their level of expertise, research theme and preferred study mode. The portal will also feature an online support service capable of assisting a wide range of researchers with their project specific enquiries.

## Project background

In 2021 the UKRI funded DaSH (Data Science in Healthcare & Biosciences) projects to develop training materials for upskilling data scientists across the life sciences, the Skills Catalyst mobilises seven of the nine DaSH projects and will further develop the established training network.

## Project goals 

The Digital Skills Catalyst Portal will empower researchers with the following features:

- Streamlined access to all the courses provided by the above DaSH projects
- Detailed pre-requisites and outcomes for courses and materials to help assess learning requirements
- Bookable time slots for one-to-one bespoke guidance with a Digital Research Infrastructure specialist from one of the DaSH projects
- Additional accreditation for new and existing courses to cater for Continuing Professional Development needs
- Occasional in-person workshops and networking events to help address ever evolving training needs
