## Welcome to the UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst on Github ðŸ‘‹

The UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst connects researchers and innovators from a range of disciplines to varied training materials through the provision of a dynamic learning portal. The portal will provide a sophisticated and dynamic search function to enable researchers to easily locate training resources appropriate to their level of expertise, research theme and preferred study mode. The portal will also feature an online support service capable of assisting a wide range of researchers with their project specific enquiries.

## Project background

In 2021 the UKRI funded DaSH (Data Science in Healthcare & Biosciences) projects to develop training materials for upskilling data scientists across the life sciences, the Skills Catalyst mobilises seven of the nine DaSH projects and will further develop the established training network.
