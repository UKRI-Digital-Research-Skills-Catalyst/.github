## Welcome to the UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst on Github ðŸ‘‹

The UKRI Digital Research Skills Catalyst connects researchers and innovators from a range of disciplines to varied training materials through the provision of a dynamic learning portal. The portal will provide a sophisticated and dynamic search function to enable researchers to easily locate training resources appropriate to their level of expertise, research theme and preferred study mode.
